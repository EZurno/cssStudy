        <h1>BEST</h1><h1>HORROR</h1><h1>SCENES</h1>
        <h3>An ever growing collection featuring some of the best scenes in horror.</h3>
        <p>“Best Horror Scenes” is a collection of scenes I feel are some of the most affecting in horror.
          Some may be simple black cat scares, others may be more subdued or nuanced.
          Many come from films that aren't necessarily “horror” but have elements or threads of horror.</p>

                It seems I’m in the minority in my love for this film. 
                Something just works for me. 
                The handheld camera work. 
                The simple disguises. 
                Their deadpan and mumbled delivery. 
                Their uncanny ability to be anywhere and everywhere instantly. 
                I remember having a tough time with the ending originally, 
                but now I can’t imagine it any other way.

                The first 34 minutes of Mute Witness are some of the most suspenseful 
                I’ve experienced in any film, 
                and the first 5 minutes some of the funniest. 
                It features an inspired 15-minute cat-and-mouse 
                chase through a labyrinthian film studio after Billy, a mute make-up artist, 
                stumbles upon a snuff film being shot in the studio after hours. The chase features several 
                perfectly timed near misses that must have been incredibly difficult to nail.
                An interesting tidbit: Anthony Waller, the director, had a moment of serendipity when he bumped into Sir Alec 
                Guinness a full three years before filming on Mute Witness began. He took a chance and asked if Alec would be willing to 
                shoot a cameo for his next film. To his surprise, Guinness said he’d be delighted and that he would do it for free. 
                Guinness was booked for the next eighteen months, so Waller suggested they shoot the scene the following morning in an underground car park. 
                Guinness readily agreed and, true to his word, took no payment.
                It would be Sir Alec Guinness’s final film.

                Orphan is a little too slick for its own good. 
                It looks and feels stylistically like so many other films, 
                which in turn made it difficult for me to really recall anything specific about the film other than the final act. 
                I did remember that I was surprised at how much I liked it, so I gave it a re-watch.
                It is much better than you might expect it to be. Isabelle Fuhrman, 
                who plays the titular orphan, 
                is phenomenal and really makes the film work. 
                Vera Farmiga is great but I grew very tired of the frequent weeping sessions, 
                which she tends to lean on a bit too much. Peter Sarsgaard is creepy, and not in a good way. 
                More in the completely two-dimensional male ego way. There is a sort of weak backstory for the family that’s entirely unnecessary, not really used, and barely even touched on.
                I wouldn’t consider this my first choice if I were digging through the archives looking for something to watch, 
                but it isn’t half bad for a back-up plan. If it wasn’t for Isabelle Fuhrman’s performance, I’d pass this one over completely.
